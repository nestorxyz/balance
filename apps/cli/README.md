# @dreamxist/bal-cli

> Command-line interface for [Balance](https://github.com/dreamxist/balance) — opinionated personal finance with `delta = 0` reconciliation.

`bal` is a thin TypeScript CLI that talks to a self-hosted Balance backend (Supabase + PostgreSQL + Edge Functions). It is **read/write**: list accounts, register transactions, manage API keys, and check whether your books are balanced — without leaving the terminal.

Money arguments accept two decimal places in Spanish or English notation (for
example `1.234,56` or `1,234.56`). Internally and in PostgreSQL, money is integer
hundredths. JSON and CSV exports emit monetary fields as exact two-place strings.

`@dreamxist/bal-cli` is just the client. To use it, you need a backend — see the [self-hosting guide](https://github.com/dreamxist/balance/blob/main/SETUP.md).

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @dreamxist/bal-cli
```

Requires **Node 22+**.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Point the CLI at your backend for the initial login
export SUPABASE_URL="https://<project-ref>.supabase.co"
export SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="<publishable-key>"

# Authenticate with an API key minted from the web app
bal login --api-key bal_live_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Show net position vs. accumulated transactions
bal balance
```

The initial login stores the backend URL and publishable key in
`~/.balance/config.json`, and caches the session in `~/.balance/session.json`.
Both files use mode `0600`. Subsequent `bal` commands work from any directory
without re-exporting the backend variables. The plaintext `bal_...` API key is
not stored in either file.

To install the CLI directly from a local checkout instead of npm:

```bash
npm run build --workspace apps/cli
npm pack --workspace apps/cli --pack-destination /tmp
npm install -g /tmp/dreamxist-bal-cli-*.tgz
```

### Recurring charges

Automatic charges are auto-registered by the `daily-charges` cron (and by `sync`)
on their day of the month. Manual charges are ones you pay yourself — they are
surfaced when you run `bal balance` in an interactive terminal, which applies any
due automatic charges and asks which manual ones you have paid.

| `bal recurring list [--entity personal\|spa] [--due] [--include-inactive]` | List charges with their monthly status (charged / due / upcoming), type (auto/manual), entity and account. |
| `bal recurring create [name] [amount] --day <1-31> --category <id> --account <name\|id> [--manual] [--usd <n> --rate <clp>]` | Create a charge — automatic by default, `--manual` for ones you pay yourself. Prompts interactively when args are omitted. |

| `bal spa invoice list [--direction emitida\|recibida] [--month YYYY-MM]` | List invoices. |
| `bal spa invoice create --direction <d> --counterpart <name> --neto <amount> [--doc-type] [--folio] [--account] [--create-transaction]` | Create an invoice. `--doc-type`: `factura_afecta\|factura_exenta\|factura_exportacion\|boleta\|nota_credito`. |
| `bal spa invoice pay <invoice-id> --account <name\|id>` | Mark an invoice as paid. |

| `bal spa f29 <YYYY-MM>` | Compute F29 summary for a given month. |
| `bal spa f29-declarar <YYYY-MM> [--codigo code=value ...] [--folio]` | Mark a period declared, storing the official SII codes (source of truth). |
| `bal spa sueldo <amount> --to <personal account>` | Owner salary: inter-entity transfer SpA → personal. |
| `bal spa annual [year]` | Annual summary. |

Chilean tax notes: foreign SaaS purchases use `bal spa gasto` (expense, no VAT credit — rolls into the annual income tax, not the monthly F29); domestic purchases with VAT use `bal spa invoice create --direction recibida`. The official SII F29 codes are the source of truth — store them with `bal spa f29-declarar --codigo`.

### Conventions

- **Amount parsing**: plain integers (`12000`), thousand-separated (`12.000`, `12,000`), or amounts with up to two decimal places (`166.35`, `166,35`, `1.234,56`, `1,234.56`). Money is stored internally as integer minor units, so decimal input stays exact.
- **Account selection**: `--account` accepts UUID or a substring of the name (case-insensitive fuzzy match). Ambiguous matches error out.
- **JSON output**: every read command accepts `--json` for machine-readable output. Useful for piping into `jq`, scripts, or other tools.
- **Transaction immutability**: transactions are never updated or deleted. Corrections use `bal undo` (creates a compensating adjustment).

## Environment variables

| Var | Purpose | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Your Balance backend URL. | Yes |
| `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Publishable key from the Supabase project. | Yes |
| `BAL_API_KEY` | Default API key for `bal login` (avoids passing `--api-key`). | No |
| `BAL_EMAIL` / `BAL_PASSWORD` | Default credentials for `bal key create/list/revoke` (which require fresh password auth). | No |
| `BAL_SESSION_FILE` | Override the session cache path (default `~/.balance/session.json`). | No |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Read as fallbacks for the two `SUPABASE_*` vars. | No |

The CLI does **not** read `.env` files automatically. Use a tool like [direnv](https://direnv.net) or your shell profile to export the vars.

## Backend setup

`bal` needs a Balance backend. Spinning one up takes ~30 minutes:

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. Push the migrations from the [Balance monorepo](https://github.com/dreamxist/balance) (`supabase db push`).
3. Deploy the Edge Functions (`auth-apikey`, `daily-charges`, `daily-backup`, `api-docs`).
4. Set `CRON_SECRET` and schedule the daily cron jobs.
5. Sign up via the web app and generate your first API key.

## Security notes

- API keys are SHA-256 hashed in Postgres. Plaintext is shown exactly once.
- Sessions are stored at `~/.balance/session.json` with mode `0600`. Treat that file as a secret.
- The `auth-apikey` Edge Function is rate-limited (5 failed attempts per IP per 5 minutes).
- All RPC calls use a **user JWT**, never `service_role`. RLS enforces tenancy in the database.

## Versioning

This package follows semver from `1.0.0` onward. Pre-1.0 releases may break between minor versions — pin if you script against `bal --json` outputs.
